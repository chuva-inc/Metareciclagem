# freelinking.module Installation Instructions

1. Copy the freelinking/ directory into your Drupal installation's
   modules/ directory.

2. Enable the freelinking module in admin/modules.

3. (optional) Set configuration options how you want them in
   admin/settings/freelinking

4. Enable the freelinking filter in one of your input formats in
   admin/settings/filters. This filter should play well with other
   filters, but it might need to be last in the chain so that links
   aren't overwritten.

5. Set permissions in admin/user/permissions#module-freelinking. Users
   need the "access freelinking list" permission to follow freelinks.
