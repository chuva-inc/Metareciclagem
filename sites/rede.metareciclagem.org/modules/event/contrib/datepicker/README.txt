This module adds a jQuery Date picker to event module's date select
box.

To use it you need to download:

1) The CSS from 
http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/datePicker/v2/demo/styles/datePicker.css

2) The Date jQuery library from
http://github.com/vitch/jquery-methods/raw/master/date.js

3) The datePicker jQuery library from
http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datepicker/
You should probably use the minified version. Rename it to jquery.datePicker.js.


All three files need to be put into the module's directory.

The code is based on
http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/datePicker/v2/demo/datePickerIntoSelects.html
