Description:
------------

This module is an exporter for SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online
Community) metadata. For more information, see rdfs.org/sioc.

When browsing nodes or comments in forums or blogs, you will see links to SIOC
metadata on the menu (e.g. "sioc forum", "sioc post") which will bring you to
the corresponding metadata export for that item.
