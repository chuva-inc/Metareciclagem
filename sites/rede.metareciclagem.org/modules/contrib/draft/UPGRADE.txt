================================================================
UPGRADING FROM VERSION 6.x-1.1 to 6.x-1.2
================================================================
THE DRAFT MODULE PROVIDES AN UPGRADE PATH TO TRY AND KEEP ANY
CHANGES TO A MINIMUM. BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS UPGRADE PLEASE
BACKUP YOUR DATABASE SO YOU CAN REVERT BACK IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

1) Go to Admin / Site Building / Modules, un-check the Draft Module
and click on the "Save Configuration" button.

2) Go to Admin / Site Building / Views, and delete the Draft List
view from the system. (This is necessary because the module has been
altered hence views handlers have been updated in the new module).

3) Go to your drupal installation and remove the old draft module from
your system and then replace it with the new draft module 6.x-2

4) Go to Admin / Site Building / Modules, check the Draft Module and
click on the "Save Configuration" button. (Module should now be
installed again on the system).

5) As user with uid 1 go to http://yoursitename/update.php and the
updates that are available for the Drafts module up to 6000 should be
installed on the system. (The upgrade adds 3 new table columns)

6) Once the cron has finished you should go back to http://yoursitename/update.php 
 and the updates that are available for Drafts should be 6001. Set this one 
and it will make sure the "cron_remove" for currently installed drafts is set
to 1 so they will not be removed). 

7) The Draft Module should now be installed in the system. Note the module
has now been split into two hence if you wish to enable Views support you 
should follow the Views support section below. (You will currently after 
this have the same functionality but the listing will be generated by a 
menu page rather than the views module).

================================================================
VIEWS MODULE INTEGRATION
================================================================
THE DRAFT MODULE PROVIDES INTEGRATION TO VIEWS VIA THE DRAFT_VIEWS
MODULE. THIS MODULE WAS SPLIT FROM THE ORIGINAL DRAFT MODULE SINCE
PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE HAVING A RELIANCE ON VIEWS FOR THE MODULE TO
BE INSTALLED AND SOME PREFERRED A PHP PAGE VIEW INSTEAD OF VIEWS

1) Go to Admin / Site Building / Modules, check the Draft Views module
and click on the "Save Configuration" button.

AT THIS POINT YOU WILL NOW HAVE VIEWS INTEGRATION WITH THE SYSTEM AND
THE DEFAULT VIEW WILL HAVE BEEN CREATED FOR USING WITH THE MODULE
