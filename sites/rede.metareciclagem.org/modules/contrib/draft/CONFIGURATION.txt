In order to enable drafts on content types you should go to the Admin > Content Types page.
In the edit portion of the Content Type under Workflow will be the ability to enable drafts
for that specific type of content. You will also be able to pick the fields in the content 
type that you wish to be the title and the body for the draft incase it is not obvious in 
the content type for the draft module. If these are not set the module will utilize title 
and body as fall backs.
