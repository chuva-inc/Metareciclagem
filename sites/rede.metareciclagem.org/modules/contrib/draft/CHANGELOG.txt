DRAFT 6.x.1-dev
===============
Module Updates:
  - Moved around the module splitting the main functionality out into seperate files so that the .module 
    file is as small as possible in order to assist with sites that have large numbers of modules. 

DRAFT 6.x.1-6
=============
New Feature:
  - #424592 Added hook_draft() to the module this allows other modules that utilize ajax in order
            to add more elements too the forms too populate the form array based on the information
            stored in the drafts table before the form is displayed. This allows for the module to
            work correctly with these module provided someone writes a handler to provide that information

Bug fixes:
  - #435532 Fixed bug when the user creates a new content type the system would not check
            if the returned fields were indeed valid since on initial creation nothing would
            be valid however the system still wanted to utilize it as an array

DRAFT 6.x-1-5
=============
Bug fixes:
  - #420564 Fixed bug where hitting Preview would re-populate the form with the draft
            information instead of preserving the users changes that they were previewing


DRAFT 6.x-1-4
=============
Bug fixes:
  - #420394 Added check for user permissions in the user edit form since the module
            was always showing the draft information even if the user did not have
            sufficient privileges to access drafts in the system

DRAFT 6.x-1-3
=============

Main features:
  - #415122 Added the ability to go back to the node edit when using the save
            draft functionality on an existing node. This will save the system
            creating a new node every time and will instead update the existing
            node already created in the system.

Bug fixes:
  - #418314 Updating the FCKEditor code so that the html is there before it finishes
            loading that way the data is put correctly in the FCKEditor box for the
            textarea
  - #416100 Added handling so the module would not fail if the content module
            does not exist in the users installation. Do not want to make the
            content module a dependency so have added code to fallback to a default
            if the content module does not exist. (This code was introduced
            originally to handle the admin selecting the Title and Body field from
            the content types list of known fields supplied by the content module)

DRAFT 6.x-1-2
=============

Main features:
  - #368017 Split Drafts and Views so there is no initial reliance on views
            PHP view has been added to the main drafts module so people can see
            their drafts

Module changes:
  - #379838 Portuguese - Brazilian translation (thansk to lourenzo)
  - #367165 updated default fields shown in the view (view was updated to
            accomodate the new fields we have in the database)
  - #361812 added configurable view url for the draft views module so the
            user can specify it if they change the draft view url

Bug fixes:
  - #406648 added units for the autosave interval in administrator settings
  - #367184 added same as above and also for user form settings
  - #368286 shortened the textfields utilized for autosave intervals
  - #369042 reworked so cron will not delete the draft is the admin specifies
  - #367171 updated the processing draft moved to right hand corner instead of
            bulky div in the middle of the users screen
  - #353252 fixed bug with node names and underscores not being handled properly
  - #367180 provided user feedback when draft was loading since it looked like
            nothing was happening for the draft populate form timeout
  - #348165 code updated for the FCKEditor and verified with their site to work
  - #361809 fixed issue where preview button would stop drafts from being saved
