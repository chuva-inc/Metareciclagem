Installation and basic configuration
====================================
 *for more details please see the handbook at http://drupal.org/node/328429

_Installing:
If you're reading this, you most likely have the module downloaded. Make sure it
is in you {drupal_root}/modules/activity or more *highly recommended*
{drupal_root}/sites/all/modules/contrib/activity.

_Enabling:
Go to {your_site}/admin/build/modules and enable Activity, and the Core Trigger
modules.

_Configuring your activity action:
NOTE: Since core's trigger/actions UIs are too limiting, we've created our own
interface to create Activity actions. Activity actions are no longer compatible
with the core action UI.
Go to {your_site}/admin/build/activity. If you currently have no activity
actions defined, you will be presented with a choice of modules. Choose the one
in which you want to configure an activity message for. i.e. if you want to
record an activity message when someone creates a new comment, choose 'Comment'
and click 'Continue'.

Next you will be given a choice of operations to choose from. Going along with
our first example choice in which we chose 'Comment', you should now see
insert, update, delete and view. Choose which operation you would like to record
an activity message for.

Think about what kind of activity you would like to record and edit the
"Description" field to reflect what the action is meant to do. A standard
description based upon your already chosen options will be filled out for you.
Feel free to make it more descriptive if you like, just so you know what it is
doing in one line.

Next you want to choose a format for your messages using the tokens that are
available in the collapsible fieldset.

The *Author message* is how the message is going to be formatted for the author
of this particular activity. So corresponding to our previous example, you might
enter something like "You updated [node-title]."

The *Public message* is how the message is going to be formatter for everyone
*other* than the author of this particular activity. So you would want to enter
something like "[user-name] updated [node-title]."

NOTE: Module who want to implement more than one message can do so. For instance,
in the case of the flag_friend module, there is a message for the user who
made the request, a message for the user recieving the request, and also a
public message. So in this instance, when User1 requests the friendship of User2,
User1 would see a message like: "You have requested to be friends with User2." -
while User2 would see a message like: "User1 has requestd to be your friend." -
and yet someone who is not involved in this relationship at all - say User3 -
could see a message like: "User1 requested to be friends with User2."

_Displaying your activity:
Display is done completely through Views 2, so make sure you have this module
installed and enabled following the same proceedure you used to install and
enable the Activity module.

Activity ships with a default view, so as soon as you go to
{your_site}/admin/build/views you will see a
"Default Activity view: all_activity  (activity)". This serves as a basic
example of how you can display your activity and can be customized to suit your
needs.
